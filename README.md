Hello and welcome to this readme file.
In this repository you'll find the school project of Floris Koek, 4th year student DBC at Fontys Tilburg.
This has been for the lecture, you guessed it, webprogramming.

I have my personal git linked to this repository, the master, and commit big changes to it.
Furthermore is the repository linked to a Azure CI-pipeline and when it recieves pushes it updates a static webpage.
you can visit this webpage at:
https://webprogrammingdbc.azurewebsites.net/

To open any of these files, simply download the code using the big green button when visiting the repository. Come on, you can't miss that one.
Then, open the files with a IDE or texteditor. I personally love Visual studio but if sublime, brackets or (god forbid) VIM is your thing thats fine as well; whatever floats your boat.
Here you can edit the code yourself.

Would you want to add to this code, you would have to:
-Fork this page, link it to your pc, work on it there
-Commit it and push it
-And then do a pull requist where I would have the change to revieuw your code and to decide if I want to accept it. 

If you quickly want the vieuw the source code of the files, simply click on the file you want. Github will provide you a overvieuw of how it is set up.

In this repository you'll find three important files (4 when including this readme).
One: index.html
here you'll find the skeleton of the page. The used recources such as google fonts but also the css and javascript file are linked here.

Second off there is the CSS; the flesh of the page. I managed my backgrounds, fonts, colors and margins with this.
Its just a CSS file so not a compiled SASS or Less page. I wanted to use a barebones CSS for this project to discover how advantigous a preprocessor is. (Hint: a damn lot)

Last but not least, there is the .js file. Here is the actual animation with GSAP coded and the animated effect when clicking an anchor.

Thank you for reading. If you have any questions, always feel free to send me a message:
