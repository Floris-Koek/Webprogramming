        <h1>Welcome fellow students and lecturer.
          <br />
          <!-- Hey don't judge. a br is fine once in a while -->
          Below you'll be journeying through my experience in making this project!</h1>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col col-3">
        <p class="main">This onepager has two functions; obviously, one being showing you what I did through
          communicating with you
          like this.
          The gist of it however, is that it at the same time functions as my project itself. This whole webpage is
          completely custom coded. Not even bootstrap has been added!
          Furthermore, if all has went well, you'll actually be visiting this on a real url! No, I didn't purchase some
          expensive domainname or any of that jazz; I actually made my first action as a DevOps.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col col-4">
        <p class="main">That basicly means this whole webpagine is hosted by Microsoft Azure. Hopefully through a so
          called CI-pipeline. This means that every change I commit automaticly gets uploaded to the cloud and onto this
          page.
          To make a long story short; I put in a lot of back-end work, to make a page that contains relatively little,
          yet has everything set up.
          <br />
          <br />
          So, without further ado, welcome to the page! As said previously, the page itself is pretty compact. That is
          because setting up the baseline is 99% of the work. Most of the info will still
          be on the final rapport, but I think this gives enough of an impression.

          I set up three main learning goals for this project: <br />
          <ol>
            <li>learning Git and Github and pushing the workspace
              environment to it.</li>
            <li>Achieving a more advanced knowledge about Javascript by making an animation with GSAP.</li>
            <li>Publicing the Javascript animation on a live static webpage
              hosted by Azure.</li>

        <p class="main">Target number one is without a doubt acomplished; I published a regular stream of commits and
          kept it informative.
          Two is shown later down below; once you get there you'll have to quickly refresh the page.
          Three is, if all went well, a succes as well. I have actually build upon 1 and 3 by taking on the additional
          task of creating a CI-pipeline.
